# Spider Island

karx's entry for PyWeek 30. Tested on Python 3.8.5 in a normal python
virtual environment on Arch Linux.

## Running

First, you must install the libraries.
You can do this by running:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Then, simply run the `run_game.py` file.

```bash
python run_game.py
# or
./run_game.py
```

## Controls

Use WASD/Arrow keys to move around. W/Up Arrow is to jump.
Use your mouse pointer to aim and click to shoot a bullet.

When you collect all the rubies and kill all the spiders, you will
move to the next level.
